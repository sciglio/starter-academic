I am a Post doc in the laboratory ([K-lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/k-lab/)) of prof. Tobias [Kippenberg](https://people.epfl.ch/tobias.kippenberg?lang=en). I obtained my PhD in quantum optics working with superconducting circuits at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se) in the groups of prof. Per [Delsing](http://www.chalmers.se/en/staff/Pages/per-delsing.aspx) and prof. Simone [Gasparinetti](https://202q-lab.se/). My research interests include light-matter interaction in a structured electromagnetic environment, quantum acoustic in microwave regime and quantum thermodynamics.

The versatility of superconducting circuits allows the study of these fields on a single platform.
